# Done is Better than Perfectâ„¢

## (but we should do these, eventually)

- Tests. (because then we'll know if we break something)
- better usage documentation
- Fix up lint / style and update githooks
- Add custom retrieval hook for `<Localization />` for folks who want to deviate from the current data model pattern.
- Improve built in `localize()` key lookup functionality
